            <h3>Make work easier for everyone</h3>
            <p>
              Too many tools are designed to make managers' jobs easier while
              making everyone else's harder. Real solutions reduce friction for
              the people doing the actual work—not just those watching from
              above.

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Fit people's real workflows</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of forcing people to adapt to rigid systems, design
              solutions that adapt to how people actually work. Meet them where
              they are, with tools that feel natural and intuitive.

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Value human judgment over process</h3>
            <p>
              Processes should support good decisions, not replace them. The
              best solutions amplify human insight rather than constraining it
              with unnecessary bureaucracy.

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Start simple, stay simple</h3>
            <p>
              Complexity compounds. Begin with the smallest thing that could
              work, and resist the urge to pile on features. Simple solutions
              scale; complicated ones break.

            I spent years building solutions for environmental and social
            challenges. Along the way, I learned that the best technology gets
            out of people's way and helps them do what they do best.
