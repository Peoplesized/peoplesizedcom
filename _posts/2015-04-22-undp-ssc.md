The site makes it easier for users to find and explore information around UNDP's support for South-South (SSC) and Triangular Cooperation (TrC) - more information about this work [here](http://www.undp.org/ssc).

Built with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) and hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) (via [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)), it is easy for the editors/administrators to keep the data current using [Prose](http://prose.io) and built-in management functions.

As a backup hosting option, we used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), with a simple drag-drop upload of the site, making it available [here](https://ssc.netlify.com).

Finally, the awesome folks at [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) provided a free account for viewing and debugging multiple devices and operating systems.
