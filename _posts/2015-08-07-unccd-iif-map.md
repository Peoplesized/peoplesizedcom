This is a dynamic map tracking the status of country parties and other entities with regard to their progress on a global goal. The data are stored in a simple file, which is easy to edit.

Reactively-templated using [ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org), this is a designed as a lightweight, self-contained map visualisation application, served from static hosting with very low ongoing costs. It is embedded in the client's CMS through an iframe.
