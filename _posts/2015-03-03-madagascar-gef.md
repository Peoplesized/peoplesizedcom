Enabling UNEP and the Government of Madagascar to develop a fully-compliant project document (including tracking tools) and CEO endorsement request for a $3.9M grant to establish new protected areas (PAs). Project carried out in French. 

Madagascar is a Least Developed Country with Human Development Index of 155 (of 187). The ultimate project objective is that the system of new PAs is effective, adequately represents key ecosystems (especially mangroves), supports good management, and delivers benefits for local people.
