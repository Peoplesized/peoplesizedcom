Concept and prototype for a way to gather quantitative data on protected area condition from people who visit. This is from 2011, but the prototype is still up - but plenty of it breaks!

Uses the API from [Protected Planet](http://protectedplanet.net)

Rails 2.3(?), OAuth to signup with Twitter/Facebook
