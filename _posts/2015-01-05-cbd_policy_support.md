Commissioned to provide technical services for the Second Meeting of the Expert Group on Biodiversity for Poverty Eradication and Development (Chennai, India, December 2013). 

Having participated in first meeting of this group on behalf of the UNEP Division of Environmental Law and Conventions, Jessica's role as a consultant was providing policy and technical guidance, including drafting issue papers, presentations and recommendations for delegates. The process has resulted in international norms around biodiversity, poverty and development mainstreaming and e.g. COP Decision XII/5: Biodiversity for poverty eradication and sustainable development.
