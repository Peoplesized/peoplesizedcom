Conducting a review of the GEF's biodiversity mainstreaming portfolio in South Africa on behalf of the World Banks's independent evaluation office (IEO) of the GEF. The primary aim is to document the conditions under which biodiversity mainstreaming is being operationalised in South Africa’s various production and economic sectors. Projects reviewed span the country's globally-valued biodiversity areas including the Cape Floristic Region, the Succulent Karoo, and the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot. The evaluation combines different data collection and analysis methods to answer a set of evaluative questions, including site visits to examine particular case studies.
