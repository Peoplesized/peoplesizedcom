*Stage 1:* Brought on to advise and guide the development of a Project Identification Form (PIF) agreeable to all partners, in a compressed timeframe. Through quick and effective facilitation and re-drafting, the PIF was approved with positive secretariat feedback and STAP consent to proceed. 

*Stage 2:* Successfully advised the development of the Project Document and CEO endorsement request, bridging state-of-the-art in biodiversity mainstreaming with the needs of 3 participating countries in southern, East and West Africa. Approved/endorsed with no requested revisions.
