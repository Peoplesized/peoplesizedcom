A BackboneJS and NodeJS based proof-of-concept, built to demonstrate and test a new approach to online reporting of environmental data. It was conceived as a component to support development a larger [UNEP-Live](http://uneplive.unep.org) initiative, which aims to simplify reporting on global environment. 

The [official deployed version](http://nrt-beta.ead.ae) is available only to staff within the Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi (not open to public). However, numerous (12+) country- specific versions were also created as part of a capacity building and user-needs gathering exercise, and these are publicly available, for example for [Ghana](http://ghana.nrt.io).
